# Challenge 26 - Insertion Sort

## what is it?

## how do you do it?
### some PSEUDO my teacher gave us
```
 InsertionSort(int[] arr)
  
     FOR i = 1 to arr.length
    
       int j <-- i - 1
       int temp <-- arr[i]      
       WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
         j <-- j - 1
        
       arr[j + 1] <-- temp
```
